These are all my problems i solved in high school (mostly in the third and forth year).
Most of the problems are taken from pbinfo.ro website - my solutions got 100 points (max).
You can also find the problems i solved, the files upploaded in this repository contain the name of the problem and the id of that problem.
Files are named according to the rule: name_id.cpp OR nameid.cpp. If they do NOT follow the rule they might not be problems from the website.
Note that the name may contain numbers or spaces(the spaces were replaced by "_"), so i suggest you to use the id to search the problems on the website.
Also, files containing "BAC" in their name are subjects from the Bacalaureat Exam - final high school exam in Romania - you can find the subjects on the website.

E.g.: fmi_orase1_3297.cpp  name="fmi orase1" , id=3297;
      2maxim119.cpp        name="2maxim" , id=119;
      BAC2021-T8.cpp
